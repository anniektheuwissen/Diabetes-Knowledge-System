<goal name="AdviceSport">
 	<description>Lifestyle Advice: Exercise</description>
	 	<answer value="SportMore">We advice you to increase the amount of exercise you do significantly.
	 	Exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depressive complaints, breast cancer, colon cancer, mental decline and dementia.
		Ideally, you should exercise actively for at least 2.5 hours a week (for example walking, cycling, running, playing football, fitness, dancing, martial arts). Also do activities that strengthen muscles and bones, such as exercise or strength training. And avoid sitting still a lot. Choose exercise / sports activities that suit you, but do not set your goals too high at the start. Even already doing a short walk everyday is very good for you!</answer>
	 	<answer value="SportaBitMore">Your answers seem to indicate that you already do quite some exercise and active movement, still we advice you to increase this a little bit. It is healthy to exercise for at least 30 minutes at least five days a week. Try to find out what you like to do. Because if you like it, you can last longer. You move quite a  it already, but more exercise is better! </answer>

<goal name="AdviceFat">
 	<description>Lifestyle Advice: Saturated and Trans Fat</description>
	 	<answer value="LessFat">You eat too much fat. Try to change this!
	 	Products with saturated and trans fat are very unhealthy. Saturated fat is commonly found in products as 48+ cheese, sausages, buttercream and chocalate, while trans fat is found in cookies, cake, chips and products from the fryer.
	 	Saturated fat and trans fat raise cholesterol. This increases the risk of obesity and arteriosclerosis and therefore more risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and problems with the kidneys.
	 	Unsaturated fat is healthier than saturated fat. It is important that you eat enough unsaturated fat. This can lower cholesterol. This reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Unsaturated fat is usually liquid. Unsaturated fat is, for example, in vegetable oils such as sunflower and olive oil.</answer>

<goal name="AdviceStress">
 	<description>Lifestyle Advice: Stress</description>
	 	<answer value="TooMuchStress">From your answers it seems that you experience problems from stress.
	 	Stress is a natural response of the body and mind to tensions. Stress can be both positive and negative. Stress is negative when you suffer from it. If you have a lot of stress for a long time, you can suffer from it both mentally and physically. Examples of physical complaints are headaches, muscle pain, sleeping problems and a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Examples of mental complaints are depression, anxiety and burnout.
	 	We recommend that you discuss your concerns with someone you trust. That often relieves you and gives you support. This gives you a better overview, which gives you stress. Do you find talking difficult? It also helps to write down problems and how you feel. You can also seek professional help from an institution or organization. </answer>
	 	<answer value="JustTooMuchStress">Your answers show that you experience some problems that may be related to an imbalance between what you can handle and what you have to do in your daily life. If you have many obligations, problems and appointments for a longer period of time, this can cause a lot of tension (stress). If you also suffer from a reduced vitality, you can get overwhelmed. If you are overworked, you suffer from stress complaints and you function less well. It is important to think about this and talk to friends, family and experts about your situation.</answer>

		When answering the questions, think about a typical week in the past month.
		With 'Moderate effort' you still have enough breath to be able to talk. For example: walking briskly, climbing stairs, cycling briskly, swimming, gardening or vacuuming.
		With 'Heavy exertion' you start to sweat. Your breath is much faster and you cannot keep talking. For example: intensive sports, running, fast cycling or heavy physical work such as digging in the garden. </description>
