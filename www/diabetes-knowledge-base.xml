<goal name="AdviceSport">
 	<description>Lifestyle Advice: Exercise</description>
	 	<answer value="SportMore">We advice you to increase the amount of exercise you do significantly. Regular exercise is one of the most importanat and effective ways to reduce your diabetes risk. Exercise also reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, depressive complaints, breast cancer, colon cancer, mental decline and dementia.
		Ideally, you should exercise actively for at least 2.5 hours a week (for example walking, cycling, running, playing football, fitness, dancing, martial arts). Also do activities that strengthen muscles and bones, such as exercise or strength training. And avoid sitting still a lot. Choose exercise / sports activities that suit you, but do not set your goals too high in the beginning. Even already doing a short walk everyday is a good start!</answer>
	 	<answer value="SportaBitMore">Your answers seem to indicate that you already do quite some exercise and active movement, still we advice you to increase your active exercise a bit. Regular exercise is one of the most importanat and effective ways to reduce your diabetes risk. Exercise also reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, depressive complaints, breast cancer, colon cancer, mental decline and dementia.
	 	It is healthy to exercise for at least 30 minutes at least five days a week. Try to find out what kind of exercise forms you prefere, because when you like it, you can last longer.  </answer>

</goal>

<goal name="AdviceStress">
 	<description>Lifestyle Advice: Stress</description>
	 	<answer value="TooMuchStress">From your answers it seems that you experience problems from stress.
	 	Stress is a natural response of the body and mind to tensions. Stress can be both positive and negative. Stress is negative when you suffer from it. If you have a lot of stress for a long time, you can suffer from it both mentally and physically. Examples of physical complaints are headaches, muscle pain, sleeping problems and a greater risk of diabetes. Examples of mental complaints are depression, anxiety and burnout.
	 	We recommend that you discuss your concerns with someone you trust. That often relieves you and gives you support. This gives you a better overview, which gives you stress. Do you find talking difficult? It also helps to write down problems and how you feel. You can also seek professional help from an institution or organization. </answer>
	 	<answer value="JustTooMuchStress">Your answers show that you experience some problems that may be related to an imbalance between what you can handle and what you have to do in your daily life. If you have many obligations, problems and appointments for a longer period of time, this can cause a lot of tension (stress). If you also suffer from a reduced vitality, you can get overwhelmed. If you are overworked, you suffer from stress complaints and you function less well. It is important to think about this and talk to friends, family and experts about your situation.</answer>
	    <answer value="no">You do not seem to suffer from too much stress, that is very good. A little bit of stress does not have to be negative, only if you suffer from it. </answer>

		With 'Heavy exertion' you start to sweat. Your breath is much faster and you cannot keep talking. For example: intensive sports, running, fast cycling or heavy physical work such as digging in the garden. </description>
